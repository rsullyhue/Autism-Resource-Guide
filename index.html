                    <strong>Why I include this:</strong>
                    AFIRM has been a lifesaver for me as a newer special ed teacher. It's not just theory, they actually show you step-by-step how to implement each practice with real classroom examples. I've used their visual support module and prompting strategies guide when writing my lesson plans this year. The video examples are especially helpful because you can see what it actually looks like in a classroom, not just read about it.

                <div class="resource-evidence">
                    <strong>What you need to know:</strong>
                    Run by UNC Chapel Hill (Frank Porter Graham Institute) with DOE funding. They review research to identify which practices actually work, so all 27 practices on there have solid evidence behind them.

                    <strong>Why it's useful:</strong>
                    Perfect for when you need PD hours or want to learn about something specific quickly. I used their modules when I was trying to figure out better ways to accommodate reading for some of my students. The scenarios feel realistic and you can work through them at your own pace. Plus you get a certificate at the end which is nice for your file.

                    Good for teachers but especially helpful to share with families who need plain-language explanations of stuff. I've sent parents here when they're trying to understand their child's IEP or want ideas for home. The IEP goal bank is something I use when I'm writing goals, it helps me make sure my language is clear and measurable.

                    <strong>What it is:</strong>
                    I haven't used this one as much as AFIRM, but their "Life Journey Through Autism" guidebooks are really comprehensive. They cover different life stages and are written for families and educators. If you're working with older students and thinking about transition, their guides on adult life are solid.

                    They fund applied research (research that's meant to be useful in real life, not just theoretical). Their guidebooks synthesize research into practical advice.

                    <strong>Why it matters:</strong>
                    This is our county's SELPA, they coordinate special ed services across all the districts in Contra Costa. They run professional development workshops that are free for teachers in the county. I went to one on AAC implementation last year that was really practical. They also have resources on compliance stuff (assessments, IEP procedures) which is good to know when you're newer to special ed.

                    When you're writing transition goals for IEPs or trying to figure out what actually helps students after high school, this is the place. They have something called the "Predictors" which are research-backed factors that lead to better post-school outcomes. I reference these when I'm justifying why we're focusing on certain transition activities.

                    Autism Speaks is controversial in the autistic community because of their history (they used to push cure narratives and didn't include autistic people in leadership). That said, I've been told that their employment toolkit is actually pretty practical. Just wanted to be upfront about the controversy. If you use their stuff, I'd recommend also looking at ASAN's resources to get the autistic perspective.

                    RCEB funds services that schools don't cover, respite for families, behavioral services outside school, day programs, supported living. As students get closer to transition age (18-22), RCEB becomes critical for setting up adult services. I've learned to start connecting families early because the earlier you build that relationship with a case manager, the smoother transition goes.

                    ASAN is run by and for autistic people, which is a perspective that's often missing from other resources. They explain why certain common practices (restraint, forced eye contact, compliance-based stuff) are traumatizing to autistic people. This has really changed how I think about some "standard" classroom management approaches. Their resources on communication access and self-advocacy are also really valuable for helping students understand and advocate for themselves.

                    <strong>Why I use it:</strong>
                    Zones gives students and teachers a shared way to talk about emotional states without judgment. The color-coded framework (blue, green, yellow, red) makes it accessible for students who struggle with abstract emotion words. I use this in my classroom and like that it acknowledges all emotions are valid, it's about learning what helps you regulate, not just "being good."

                    <strong>What makes it unique:</strong>
                    ACE is the only K-12 school in Contra Costa County that's specifically designed for autistic students. They use the Autism Model of Education (AME) which focuses on strengths-based, individualized instruction. Small class sizes, structured environment, focus on communication and social skills. Some of my students have gone there when they needed more specialized support than MDUSD could provide.

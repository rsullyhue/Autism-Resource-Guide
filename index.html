                    <strong>Why it's useful:</strong>
                    AFIRM breaks down complex evidence-based practices into step-by-step implementation guides that teachers can actually use in their classrooms. Instead of just telling you what works, it shows you exactly how to do it with real examples. This is especially helpful for teachers who are new to working with autistic students or need to implement a specific practice they haven't used before.

                    <strong>What makes it evidence-based/trustworthy:</strong>
                    AFIRM is developed by the Frank Porter Graham Child Development Institute at UNC Chapel Hill and funded by the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Special Education Programs. All 27 practices included are identified as evidence-based through rigorous research reviews conducted by the National Professional Development Center on Autism Spectrum Disorder. Each practice has been validated through multiple peer-reviewed studies showing positive outcomes for autistic learners.

                    The Transition Coalition provides practical, research-based assessment tools that go beyond checking boxes. Their assessments actually help you understand what students want, what they can do, and what they need to learn before graduation. The person-centered planning resources help you involve students meaningfully in their own transition planning, which is required by law but often hard to do well.

                    RCEB is the primary funding source for services beyond what schools provide. They can fund job coaching, day programs, behavioral services, and respite care for families. As students approach transition age (18-22), RCEB becomes crucial for setting up adult services. Building relationships with RCEB case managers early helps ensure smooth transitions from school to adult services. Many students are eligible for services you might not know about.

                <h4>Autistic Self Advocacy Network</h4>
                <p class="resource-description">Autistic-led organization providing resources on supporting autistic individuals' mental health.</p>
                
                <div class="resource-why">
                    <strong>Why it's useful:</strong>
                    ASAN provides the autistic perspective on trauma, which is often missing from other resources. They explain why certain common practices (restraint, forced eye contact, compliance-based interventions) are traumatizing to autistic people. This helps you avoid re-traumatizing students and understand why some students have strong negative reactions to things that seem harmless. Their communication strategies respect autistic ways of communicating rather than forcing neurotypical standards.
                </div>

                <div class="resource-evidence">
                    <strong>What makes it evidence-based/trustworthy:</strong>
                    ASAN is the leading autistic-led advocacy organization in the United States, run by and for autistic people. Their resources are grounded in the lived experiences of autistic individuals and informed by research on autism, trauma, and mental health. While they don't conduct traditional research studies, they provide crucial first-person perspectives that research often misses. Their materials are widely respected in the autism community and increasingly used by professionals who want to provide affirming, non-traumatizing support.

                <h4>Zones of Regulation</h4>
                <p class="resource-description">Framework for teaching self-regulation and emotional control, particularly helpful for trauma-affected students.</p>
                
                <div class="resource-why">
                    <strong>Why it's useful:</strong>
                    Zones gives students (and teachers) a common language for talking about emotional states without judgment. The visual, color-coded framework makes it accessible for students who struggle with abstract emotion words. It's particularly helpful for autistic students because it acknowledges that all emotions are valid and focuses on learning what helps you regulate rather than just "being good." The framework includes sensory strategies that many autistic students find helpful.
                </div>

                <div class="resource-evidence">
                    <strong>What makes it evidence-based/trustworthy:</strong>
                    Zones of Regulation was developed by Leah Kuypers, an occupational therapist with extensive experience working with students with social-emotional and sensory needs. The curriculum integrates research on self-regulation, executive functions, and sensory processing. While the Zones framework itself is a specific program, it's based on well-established principles from cognitive behavioral therapy, sensory integration theory, and social thinking research. The program has been widely adopted and has case studies showing positive outcomes.

                    <strong>Why it's useful:</strong>
                    This is the county mental health system that can provide school-based therapy and crisis services. Many students with autism also have mental health needs like anxiety, depression, or trauma that schools can't address alone. Behavioral Health can place therapists directly in schools or provide clinic-based services. In crisis situations, they have 24/7 support. Knowing how to access these services quickly is important for supporting students in crisis.

                    Contra Costa Behavioral Health is part of the county health system and must meet California Department of Health Care Services standards for mental health treatment. Services are provided by licensed mental health professionals (LCSWs, LMFTs, psychologists, psychiatrists) who are trained in evidence-based treatments.

                    NAMI provides education and support that helps families understand mental health conditions and how to support their child. Their family education programs give parents strategies and connect them with other families facing similar challenges. NAMI can also provide mental health education presentations at schools. This is helpful when you need to refer families for support or want to bring mental health awareness to your school community.

This is particularly valuable for students who need intensive, specialized instruction and aren't making progress in traditional special education settings. The small class sizes and high staff-to-student ratio allow for highly individualized programming that's hard to achieve in public school settings.

                <h4>Orion Academy</h4>
                <p class="resource-description">First high school in California providing college-prep education specifically for students with autism spectrum disorder.</p>
                
                <div class="resource-why">
                    <strong>Why it's useful:</strong>
                    Orion is one of the first schools in California designed specifically for college-bound autistic students who have the academic skills for college prep but struggle with the social and executive function demands of traditional high schools. This fills a gap for students who don't need academic modifications but do need support with organization, social interaction, and managing the hidden curriculum of school. The school explicitly teaches the social and pragmatic skills that are assumed in typical schools.
                </div>

                <div class="resource-evidence">
                    <strong>What makes it evidence-based/trustworthy:</strong>
                    Orion Academy is a certified nonpublic school that meets California Department of Education standards. The curriculum uses evidence-based approaches for teaching social cognition (including Social Thinking curriculum and executive function strategies). All courses are UC-approved college prep classes, meeting rigorous academic standards. Teachers have credentials in their subject areas plus training in autism and social-pragmatic instruction. The school's model is based on research about what helps autistic students succeed academically while addressing their social-cognitive differences.

                    RCEB is the gateway to services for individuals with developmental disabilities in Contra Costa and Alameda counties. They provide case management and fund services that schools don't cover, such as respite for families, behavioral services, day programs, and supported living. Getting connected early (especially for early intervention 0-3) can make a huge difference in outcomes. For school-age students, RCEB can supplement school services and help with transition planning starting at age 14.

Service coordinators help families navigate systems and connect with evidence-based services. All vendors funded by RCEB must be certified by the state and provide services that meet established standards. RCEB is required to use person-centered planning approaches shown to improve quality of life outcomes.
